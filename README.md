## Git Commands
Here are a few helpful git commands.

### 1. git init
With this command, a fresh Git repository is created in the current directory.

### 2. git clone
Use this command to copy a remote Git repository to your computer.

### 3. git status
This command displays the status of your local repository at the moment, including any changes, additions, or deletions to the files.

### 4. git stash
This command is used to save modifications that haven't been committed to a branch for the time being. When you need to work on a separate branch but don't want to commit your existing modifications, this can be helpful.

### 5. git branch
Git branch allows us to inspect all of the current branches, add a new branch to an existing branch, and delete a branch.

### 6. git commit
Make modifications to the files and maintain a local repository to track them. Each commit has a distinct ID that makes it simple to refer to it. Every commit should have a message attached to it outlining the changes that were made. This aids in understanding what changed and how it happened.

### 7. git merge
Two branches can be combined using this command, but they must not clash with one another. In essence, it merges the modifications from the commit with the branch that is now open.

### 8. git config
This git command is used to set the author's name and email address, allowing you to be recognised while making contributions on github.

### 9. git diff
The differences between two Git branches or commits are shown using this command. Finding conflicts, comparing changes, and reviewing code are all facilitated by it.

### 10. git pull
With this command, you can merge the most recent changes from a remote repository into your local branch.

## Linux Commands
Here are a few helpful Linux commands.

### 1. uniq
This command is helpful for data cleanup and removing duplicate items since it removes duplicates from a file or input.

### 2. chmod
You can manage who may read, write, or execute a file by using this command to change the permissions on a file or directory.

### 3. find
based on a variety of parameters, searches for files and directories.

### 4. isof
a list of all open files and the processes connected to them is displayed by the command. It can be useful for fixing issues with file descriptors and network connections.

### 5. pwd
The shell's built-in pwd command (print working directory) prints the current location. The output displays a root directory-based absolute directory path.

### 6. usermod
A user can be modified with the usermod command. It can change a number of user characteristics, including permissions and groups.

### 7. sudo
One of the most significant Linux commands is this one. Basically, if you run this command before any other operation, it will execute that action with higher privilegesâ€”those of the root user, which are necessary for some commands.

### 8. mount
It is utilised to link the system's file system to an external file system.

### 9. rsync
The synchronisation of files and directories between systems is accomplished with this command. It is helpful for swiftly transferring big volumes of data as well as backing up information.

### 10. cat
You can view a file's top content without opening it by using the cat command. The cat command causes a file's first few lines of code to be shown on the terminal.
